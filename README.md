Download and install the latest LTS version of Node.js here :
https://nodejs.org/en/download/

    ### NPM

NPM is a package manager that allows the installation of a lot of tools and libraries that you will need for any kind of development

    - npm install -g npm@latest

    ### ANGULAR/CLI

    -  npm install -g @angular/cli

  ## Create your first project

    - ng new my-first-projet
    - cd my-first-projet
    - ng serve --open

 ##  Whatʼs inside
 
    - e2e
    - mongo
    - server
    - src
    - .editorconfig
    - .gitignore
    - README.md
    - angular.json
    - initial
    - package-lock.json
    - package.json
    - tsconfig.json

 1. /e2e: End to end testing (E2E) or also known as integration testing is a great way to make sure at a high-level overview that our applications function correctly.
 2. /mongo: sever MongoDB is a cross-platform document-oriented database program.
  
 3. /server: This directory will contain all our sever backend using mysql ”.
 
 4. /src: This directory will contain all of the code related to what you will see on the front-end of your site (what you see in the browser) such as your site header or a page template. src is a convention for “source code”.
 
 5. /.editorconfig: EditorConfig helps maintain consistent coding styles for multiple developers working on the same project across various editors and IDEs.
 
 6. /.gitignore: This file tells git which files it should not track / not maintain a version history for.
 
 7. /README.md:  A text file containing useful reference information about your project.
 
 8. /angular.json: A file named angular. json at the root level of an Angular workspace provides workspace-wide and project-specific configuration defaults for build and development tools provided by the Angular CLI. 
 
 9. /initial: By default, the files for a new initial app (with the same name as the workspace) are placed in the src/ subfolder. Corresponding end-to-end tests are placed in the e2e/ subfolder.
 
10. /package-lock.json:  (See package.json below, first). This is an automatically generated file based on the exact versions of your npm dependencies that were installed for your project. (You won’t change this file directly).

11. /package.json: A manifest file for Node.js projects, which includes things like metadata (the project’s name, author, etc). This manifest is how npm knows which packages to install for your project.

12. /tsconfig.json: The presence of a tsconfig.json file in a directory indicates that the directory is the root of a TypeScript project. The tsconfig.json file specifies the root files and the compiler options required to compile the project.

13. /tslint.json: Analyze & Fix your Angular 6 code using TSLint. ... Angular Applications are already integrated with TSLint, tslint.json file can be found at the root of your project. TSLint is also defined as dev dependency in package.json
 
 
## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
